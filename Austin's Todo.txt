CURRENT FOCUS: Ship movement
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Current Goals: 
  - Set screen boundaries
  - Set minimum and maximum tether separation distances
  - Refine movement to make it more appealing

Completed Goals: 
  - Controller support for movement
  - Basic movement has been added, can move either tether
  - Set up a decent system for controlling settings

Long Term Goals: 
  - Multiplayer support

Untested: 
  - Keyboard movement (I copy/pasted most of the joystick stuff)
  - Multiplayer ... impossible to test at the moment.
